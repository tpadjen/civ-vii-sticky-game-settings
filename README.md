# Sticky Game Settings

A Civ VII mod that remembers your previous game settings when starting a new game.

Most of the common game settings are now persistent:

- Difficulty
- Speed
- Map Type
- Map Size
- Age Length
- Disaster Intensity
- Crises On/Off

Each time you make a change to one of the settings above it will stay the same until changed again, across loads and restarts.

This mod also adds a small amount of info to the in-game pause screen. It shows the chosen values of all of these persistent game settings above the map seed, similiarly to how the difficulty and speed are currently visible without mods. This helps with verification that everything loaded as you wished.

The mod disables itself for the current session when a game configuration save is loaded. The previous settings before loading the configuration will reset themselves the next time the main menu loads (after a game exits or the app restarts).
